## About the Coordinate System
- **Ground Coordinate System (NED)**: The NED coordinate system uses a ground-fixed reference frame, defining positions in terms of North (X), East (Y), and Down (Z) axes. This system is commonly used in aviation and helps in intuitively understanding the position of drones.

## About the Origin
- The origin point is defined by the initial values of latitude, longitude, and altitude (ALT) provided. This origin serves as the reference point for all positional measurements of the drone in the NED coordinate system.

## Interpreting Position Data
- In the NED coordinate system, positive values in the X and Y axes indicate a position to the North and East of the origin, respectively. For the Z axis, a positive value indicates a position below the origin point, aligning with the downward orientation of the Z axis in the NED system.

## About the Unit
- **Meter**: The position of the drone along each axis is measured in meters. This ensures precision in positioning, conforming to international standards.

# Velocity

This section outlines the coordinate system and units used for measuring the drone's velocity, along with relevant details.

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Coordinate System  | Ground Coordinate System (NED)                   |
| Unit               | Meters per Second (m/s)                          |
| X                  | Velocity towards the North                       |
| Y                  | Velocity towards the East                        |
| Z                  | Velocity downwards (towards the ground)          |

## About the Coordinate System
- **Ground Coordinate System (NED)**: For velocity measurements, the NED coordinate system is used. In this system, the axes are oriented North (X), East (Y), and Down (Z), effectively representing the drone's movement in three-dimensional space.

## About the Unit
- **Meters per Second (m/s)**: The velocity of the drone is measured in meters per second. This unit is the standard for speed measurement, offering a clear and consistent way to gauge how fast the drone is moving in each direction.

## Interpreting Velocity Data
- The velocity data represents the rate of change of position along each axis of the NED coordinate system. Positive values in the X and Y axes indicate movement towards North and East, respectively. For the Z axis, a positive value indicates movement downwards (towards the ground), in line with the orientation of the NED coordinate system.

# Angle

This section details the orientation of the drone, described in terms of angles along the NED coordinate system axes, and measured in radians.

| Yaw                | Rotation around the Z-axis (Down)                |

## About the Coordinate System
- **Ground Coordinate System (NED)**: The NED system is used to describe the orientation of the drone. In this system, roll, pitch, and yaw angles are defined relative to the North (X), East (Y), and Down (Z) axes respectively.

## About the Unit
- **Radian**: Angles are measured in radians, providing a standard and precise way to quantify rotation. One full rotation (360 degrees) equals 2Ï€ radians.

## Interpreting Angle Data
- **Roll**: A positive roll angle indicates a clockwise rotation when viewed from the rear, tilting the right wing down and the left wing up.
- **Pitch**: A positive pitch angle denotes the nose of the drone tilting up.
- **Yaw**: A positive yaw angle signifies a clockwise rotation when viewed from above, turning the drone to the right.

These angular orientations help in understanding the drone's attitude in 3D space, crucial for navigation and control.

# Angular Velocity

This section explains the measurement of the drone's angular velocity, which is the rate of change of its angular position over time.

## About the Unit
- **Radian per Second (rad/s)**: Angular velocity is measured in radians per second. This unit quantifies how quickly the drone is rotating about each of the three axes.

## Interpreting Angular Velocity Data
- **Roll Rate**: A positive value indicates a clockwise rotation around the X-axis when viewed from the rear.
- **Pitch Rate**: A positive value denotes a nose-up rotation around the Y-axis.
- **Yaw Rate**: A positive value signifies a clockwise rotation around the Z-axis when viewed from above.

Understanding these rates of angular velocity is crucial for controlling the drone's orientation and for stabilizing its flight.
